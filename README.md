# Node File Manager

A File Manager with Node.js

- Works using CLI
- Navigation (up, cd, ls)
- Performs basic file operations (copy - cp path_to_file path_to_new_directory, move - mv path_to_file path_to_new_directory, delete - rm path_to_file, rename - rn path_to_file new_filename, create empty file - add new_file_name, read file - cat path_to_file)
- Utilizes Streams API
- Gets information about the host machine operating system (os --EOL, os --cpus, os --homedir, os --username, os --architecture)
- Performs hash calculations (hash path_to_file)
- Compresses and decompresses files (compress path_to_file path_to_destination, decompress path_to_file path_to_destination)
